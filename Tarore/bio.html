    <a>Tarore was a young Māori girl from the Ngāti Hauā iwi, born around 1824. She was the daughter of Wiremu Ngākuku, a chief of Ngāti Hauā in the Matamata region of New Zealand's North Island. Tarore became notable for her literacy and deep Christian faith at a young age. She learned to read at the mission school established by Reverend Alfred Brown and his wife, Charlotte, in Matamata. Gifted with an exceptional memory, Tarore memorized and recited large portions of the Gospel of Luke to gatherings of her people, sometimes numbering 200–300 individuals. Her father supported her in this role, recognizing her as a lay evangelist.

        In October 1836, due to escalating tribal conflicts, the mission school was evacuated. Tarore, then about 12 years old, carried a rare Māori-language copy of the Gospel of Luke in a small kete (basket) around her neck. On the night of October 18, while camped near the Wairere Falls in the Kaimai Ranges, their group was attacked by a war party from Ngāti Whakaue. Tarore was tragically killed, and her precious book was stolen.

        At her tangi (funeral), her father, Ngākuku, made a profound statement, urging against seeking revenge for her death. He said, "There lies my child; she has been murdered as a payment for your bad conduct; but do not you rise to seek a payment for her, God will do that. Let this be the finishing of the war with Rotorua. Now let peace be made."
